# Goals

This package is for developing an authorization microservice that uses:
- Google SSO for authentication
- GCloud secrets for holding the RBAC database
- JWT tokens for passing bearer tokens around to various other services

The motivation is varied but primary focus is on:
- refreshing my flask skills
- updating my knowledge of modern OAuth 2.0 and JWT web tokens
- creating a service i can use for a personal cluster gateway to expose my code to outside users with a Gmail
